/**
 * THE SIMULATION DOES NOT MOVE. This file is the proof.
 *
 * The HD pass (see `docs/` and `src/browser/hd-scale.ts`) is presentation only:
 * 4x artwork, 4x sprites, finer sprite placement, a bigger canvas. None of that
 * is allowed to change a single tick of the simulation, and "allowed" is not a
 * promise anyone has to keep by being careful — it is pinned here.
 *
 * Each constant below is the sha256 over the concatenated per-tick
 * `debugSnapshot` JSON of a 4,000-tick scripted game on the shipped table,
 * recorded at commit 57e6d0c — the tree as it stood BEFORE any HD change
 * landed. The script serves, launches, flips, and nudges through several balls,
 * so the hash covers the plunger, the flipper strokes, ball physics on all
 * levels the script reaches, drains, locks, scoring, the mission VM and the
 * camera. If any of these hashes ever changes, a change that claimed to be
 * render-only reached the simulation, and the change — not this pin — is wrong.
 *
 * The harness is deliberately the same shape as the determinism suite in
 * `game-loop.test.ts`: a `ScriptedInput` whose behaviour is a pure function of
 * the tick index, driving the real maps, the real physics and the real mode VM.

 * The pinned hashes, one per table, recorded at HEAD 57e6d0c (pre-HD) and
 * RE-PINNED for the ball-search stall fix (see below).
 *
 * To re-derive after an INTENDED simulation change (there should be none in an
 * HD round): run this suite, read the "actual" value out of the failure, and
 * update the constant in the same commit that moved the simulation — with the
 * move itself explained in the commit message.
 *
 * RE-PIN, ball-search stall fix: two Law 'n Justice census games stalled
 * forever because a ball wedged in the map pockets flanking the upper bat —
 * (24,304) and (41,339), level 0 — was in mask contact with the RESTING bat
 * on every tick, and any bat contact made it cradle-exempt, so `stillTicks`
 * was reset to 0 forever and the search never fired. The fix narrows the
 * cradle exemption to bats the player is DRIVING and freezes (rather than
 * resets) the clock while every free ball is in a driven bat's grip. That
 * moves `stillTicks` — a field of every per-tick snapshot hashed here — on
 * all three tables, and lets the rescue fire where it previously never
 * could, so the old hashes describe a machine with the stall in it. Verified
 * while re-pinning: with `stillTicks` excluded from the snapshot, all three
 * 4,000-tick scripted games hash identically before and after the fix — no
 * ball position, velocity, score or serve in this script's coverage moved;
 * only the stillness bookkeeping did.
